# Basic Recurrent Neural Network

Recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of deep learning model that is mostly used for analysis of sequential data (time series data prediction). There are different application areas that are used: Language model, neural machine translation, music generation, time series prediction, financial prediction, etc. The aim of this implementation is to help to learn structure of basic RNN (RNN cell forward, RNN cell backward, etc..).Code is adapted from Andrew Ng's Course 'Sequential models'.
