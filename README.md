# Basic Recurrent Neural Network

* Recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of deep learning model that is mostly used for analysis of sequential data (time series data prediction). 
* There are different application areas that are used: Language model, neural machine translation, music generation, time series prediction, financial prediction, etc. 
* The aim of this implementation is to help to learn structure of basic RNN (RNN cell forward, RNN cell backward, etc..).
* Code is adapted from Andrew Ng's Course 'Sequential models'.
